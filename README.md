# Rainbow Tag

## SCP:SL  ServerMod Plugin that makes your server tags a rainbow.
That's literally all it does. 

## Adding users:
To make a users' tag rainbow; go to your server's data area and find the rainbow tag folder, `(~/.config/SCP Secret Laboratory/RainbowTag) on Linux` and add their SteamID64's to the existing file. One ID per line.

### Some more helpful information:
`rt_timer_delay` - the time in seconds between color changes. Defaults to 0.1 second(s). 

`reloadrainbow` - RA command to re-save the list and apply changes to the tags.
